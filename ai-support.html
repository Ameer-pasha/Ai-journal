                <p class="ai-intro"><span class="sparkle-icon">✨</span> It sounds like you're feeling confused and maybe a little hurt or frustrated when your parents scold you for bad marks. That's a really understandable feeling to have. It's tough when you're trying your best, or even just navigating the challenges of school, and the response you get is scolding.</p>

                <p>Sometimes, when parents scold, it comes from a place of their own worries and anxieties. They might be worried about your future, or about you not reaching your full potential, or even about how it reflects on them. It's often not because they think you're a "bad" person or because they want to hurt you, but rather a clumsy way of expressing their concern.</p>
